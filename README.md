# Notes on Bitcoin

This repository contains my **personal notes** collected while studying different aspects of Bitcoin.

The repository is divided in these folders:

- [`bitcoin_technical_theory/`](./bitcoin_technical_theory/): Technical contents about how the Bitcoin network works. The most important source of information is the book ["Mastering Bitcoin", by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (O'Reilly, 2nd Edition)](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/tree/develop).
- [`bitcoin_practical/`](./bitcoin_practical/): Practical, technical notes about how to interact with the Bitcoin network; e.g., how to set up a personal node, best practices, etc. Additionally, legal aspects are/will be covered here.
- [`bitcoin_economics_philosophy/`](./bitcoin_economics_philosophy/): Non-technical notes related to economics, philosophy and psychology.
