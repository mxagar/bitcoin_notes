# Notes on Bitcoin

This repository contains my **personal notes** collected while studying different aspects of Bitcoin.

The most important source of information are these **technical books**:

- "Mastering Bitcoin", Antonopoulos, O'Reilly: [`bitcoin_antonopoulos/`](./bitcoin_antonopoulos/).
- "Mastering the Lightning Network", Antonopoulos et al., O'Reilly: [`bitcoin_lightning_antonopoulos/`](./bitcoin_lightning_antonopoulos/).
- "Programming Bitcoin", Song, O'Reilly: [`bitcoin_programming_song/`](./bitcoin_programming_song/).

Additionally, I have also covered other topics from different sources:

- Practical technical notes in [`bitcoin_practical/`](./bitcoin_practical/); e.g., how to set up a personal node, best practices, etc.
- Non-technical notes related to economics, philosophy and psychology in [`bitcoin_philosophy_literature/`](./bitcoin_philosophy_literature/).
