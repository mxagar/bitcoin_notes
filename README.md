# Notes on Bitcoin

This repository contains my **personal notes** collected while studying the Bitcoin network.

The main source of information are these books:

- "Mastering Bitcoin", Antonopoulos, O'Reilly
- "Mastering the Lightning Network", Antonopoulos et al., O'Reilly
- "Programming Bitcoin", Song, O'Reilly

Basically, I've done a summary of them.

Note that I don't use Markdown style, but my personal formatting in TXT: ideas are hierarchically indented -- I find this style to be very comfortable and fast for checking any information.
